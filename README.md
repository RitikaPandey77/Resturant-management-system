# Restaurant-management-system
Python GUI for Resturant Management 

Well, I am a foodie....

I love eating tasty food. So, at times when I am out with my friend we use to go to a street side food corner cuz they are cheap and food is also tasty. Sometimes we order so much that it's really a big trouble for the owner to do the calculation. Well that was the idea origin moment of this project. It deals with a Resutant management system to make bill easy and effeciently without even use of calculator. just enter the amount of items consumed and here you go...

Well I had to keep the project generalised so for the prices (cuz they differ from region to region) I used random initialization of price form 100 to 500 :)

Library support in python is just amazing and I used the following libraries to build this masterpiece so make sure you have them installed in you device before running the code.
1. Tkinter:- Documentation:- https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html 
2. Random:- Documentation:- https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html
3. Time:- Documentation:- https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html

Make sure that you are running this project on Python 3. 

I didn't use any sort of database to store the billing amount but it may be useful to do so in order to incerase the practicality and effeciency of the project.

I learned a lot while making this project and I am sure it will teach you the same.

# Enjoyyy............ :)
